# DeepSatCom: DSPG + SAC for LEO Satellite Resource Allocation

This repository is part of the **DeepSatCom Project**, which focuses on designing deep learning frameworks for **interference management in satellite communications**.  
The provided script demonstrates a **hybrid Discrete Softmax Policy Gradient (DSPG) + Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** approach for **resource allocation in LEO satellite networks**.
